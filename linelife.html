<h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>
<p><em>Linelife</em> is &quot;Conway's game of Life in one dimension&quot;. Instead of a grid of cells,
one has an infinite line of cells, all with two possible values, alive or dead &mdash; a picture probably
reminicient to many of a Turing machine. Indeed, a <em>population</em> in
Linelife can be understood as a binary sequence. Linelife is not an elementary
cellural automaton, however; its rules are more complicated.</p>

<p><em>linelife</em> is a simple CLI program that simulates the game.</p>


<h3 id="rules">Rules</h3>

<p>The rules are essentially the same as Conway's original game. The definition
of a &quot;neighbouring cell&quot; is changed: all those cells that are at a distance
of 4 or less from a given cell are <em>neighbours</em> to that cell:
<pre>
          _____cell in question
          |
   ...xxxxXxxxx...
      \|/  \|/
       |____|____its eight neighbours
</pre>
After this definition is given, it remains to decide the rules of being born and
dying. Let <em>n</em> be the number of alive neighbours for a given cell. In
Conways original game the rules are:
<ul>
<li>if the cell is alive and <em>n</em>&lt;2 or <em>n</em>&gt;3, the cell dies;</li>
<li>if the cell is dead and <em>n</em>=3, the cell becomes alive;</li>
<li>otherwise no change in this cell.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Other rulesets might prove more interesting for Linelife. Conway's ruleset
can also be called the S23-B3 ruleset, for cells with 2 or 3 neighbours
'S'urvive, whereas a 'B'irth requires exactly 3 neighbours. A potentially more
interesting ruleset for Linelife is S34-B3.</p>

<p>See below for a more detailed comparison of these rulesets.</p>


<h3 id="program">The <em>linelife</em> program</h3>

<p><em>linelife</em> can be used to automatize and visualize Linelife in
practice. The program is written in C++ and uses Curses for the interface. It
<em>should</em> work in any UNIX-line system. The provided Makefile contains rules
for compiling a normal version or a minimal program without the Curses
interface. The Makefile also defines the used ruleset, by default it is S34-B3.
Please see the provided man page for further information about
using the program.</p>

<p>Limitations worth knowing about: Due to the way the data is stored
internally, the line has a maximum length, usually 2<sup>64</sup> or
2<sup>32</sup> depending on your machine. Some buggy behaviour is likely if your
pattern is at either end of the line (due to integers wrapping around).
There is no undo function at the moment,
except that you can achieve an undo by hitting 'bm', but this only works if you
have ran at least one generation prior to doing any editing, and it undos
everything done after running a step.</p>


<h3 id="trivia">Trivia</h3>
<p>With the classical Conway rules, S23-B3, Linelife features a large variety of
static patterns. No short pattern (patterns up to length 34 have been
exhaustively tested) shows variety beyond 26 generations. There are some
repeating patterns (with periods 2, 3, and 6), but no moving patterns (such as
the &quot;glider&quot; in Conway's game).</p>

<p>With the ruleset S34-B3, there is a rather simple moving pattern, which has
been named &quot;a crawler&quot;. It has 8 states, the simplest of which is
<pre>1011011</pre>
In 8 generations this pattern moves, going through various changes, 12 steps to the right.
A vast amount of repeating patterns with period 2 exist, but there are no genuinely static
patterns (many of the patterns that are periodic with period 2 are mostly static
and only change at the ends). Other interesting patterns also exists, such as a
repeating pattern with period 40:
<pre>1001101001011011</pre>
Periodic patterns of periods 4 and 6 also appear. This ruleset seems much more
fascinating, at least from the perspective that even very simple (short) patterns
should produce interesting evolutions.</p>
