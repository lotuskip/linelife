.TH LINELIFE 1
.SH NAME
linelife \- a simple CLI program for playing the Lifeline game
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B linelife
.RB [ \-n " <number of generations>"]
.RB [ "intial pattern in 0s and 1s"]
.RB [ \-s ]
.RB [ \-b " <filename>"]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B linelife
can be run either in automatic or interactive mode.
.P
In automatic mode, linelife simply iterates a pattern for as many
generations as specified by the integer argument, or until a static state is
reached. To start this mode, you must give the argument '-n' followed by the
maximum number of generations to run. If lifeline was compiled without Curses
support, this is the only way to run the program.
.P
Passing the argument '-s' tells lifeline to print each generation as they are
processed. Otherwise only the final state is printed. The argument '-s' has no
effect in interactive mode.
.P
There are three ways to give the initial pattern (a string consisting of the
symbols '0' (living cell) and '1' (dead cell)): (1) as a command line
argument; (2) in a file, then name of which is given after the '-b' argument;
and, if neither argument is given, (3) the pattern is read from stdin. The last
alternative obviously is not available in interactive mode.
.P
With the '-b' argument you can do a batch run; if the file contains more than
one pattern (separated by newlines), they will all be processed.
.P
In the interactive mode, an "infinite" line of cells is drawn on the screen, and
you can manipulate it in various ways.
.SH COMMANDS
The following keys are available in the interactive mode:
.P
Movement keys, always usable:
.TP
.B h/left
scroll left
.TP
.B l/right
scroll right
.TP
.B k/up
increase scroll step (up to 100000)
.TP
.B j/down
decrease scroll step (down to 1, which it is initially)
.P
Playback commands (to automatically run the cell simulation):
.TP
.B >
increase playback speed (max: 1 step per 200ms)
.TP
.B <
decrease playback speed (min and initial: 1 step per second; the incr/decr step is 200ms)
.TP
.B .
stop playback (set speed to 0)
.TP
.B ,
toggle pause (remembers speed)
.P
.B Selection mode
is entered by pressing
.B v
\, This will automatically stop playback. In selection mode you select an
interval of the cells instead of just moving the cursor. In addition to the
movement keys:
.TP
.B tab/esc
exit selection mode
.TP
.B	1/0
set all cells in the selection alive/dead
.TP
.B y
yank (copy) the selection
.TP
.B d
delete the selection and put it in the copy buffer
.P
The following keys are available when not in selection mode, and using them will
automatically stop any playback:
.TP
.B n
print current population (number of alive cells), length of pattern (number of
cells from leftmost to rightmost living cell), density (population / length),
and shift of the leftmost alive cell with respect to the initial pattern
.TP
.B g
print current generation number (note that this is not reset if manual
modifications to the population are made)
.TP
.B G
go to generation (enter number after hitting 'G'); can be used to go back
in history or to fast-forward to the future
.TP
.B m/b
run one step forward/back
.TP
.B x
exchange the cell under the cursor with its neighbour in the typing direction
.TP
.B 1/0
set cell under cursor alive/dead and move cursor in	current typing direction
.TP
.B T
toggle typing direction left/right (initially right)
.TP
.B p
paste selection, inserting
.TP
.B P
paste selection, overwriting (note that 'P' starts at the cursor position,
but 'p' inserts after the cursor like in vi; note also that the pastings happen
in the typing direction)
.TP
.B space
toggle cell under cursor alive/dead (does not move cursor)
.TP
.B S
save current situation into a text file (the name of which you will be asked).
What exactly is saved is a string of 0s and 1s from the leftmost living cell to
the rightmost.
.TP
.B O
load a situation from a text file (replaces whatever is currently shown and clears history)
.TP
.B E
erase history, set generation number to 0
.TP
.B :
after which you enter a shell command; this will save into a temporary file '/tmp/ll',
run your command, and load '/tmp/ll' again
.P
The following keys are again usable always, and they do not stop playback:
.TP
.B r
resets the view (puts the cursor at the middle point between the leftmost and
rightmost living cells)
.TP
.B s
show current selection (the content of the copy buffer)
.TP
.B t
print cursor position (a program internal; useful for debugging)
.TP
.B q
quits the program
.SH FILES
.B /tmp/ll
is the file used for temporary manipulations by external programs.
